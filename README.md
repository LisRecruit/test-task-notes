# üìù Note Task Manager

A RESTful **Spring Boot** application for managing notes ‚Äî allowing you to **create, view, update, and delete** notes,  
as well as retrieve **word statistics** for each note.  
The app uses **MongoDB** for data storage and is fully containerized with **Docker Compose**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java 21
- **Framework:** Spring Boot 3
- **Database:** MongoDB 6.0
- **Build Tool:** Gradle
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito, Testcontainers

## üß© Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have:

- Java 21+ (only needed for local builds)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed

---

## üöÄ Running with Docker Compose

The project is preconfigured for isolated Docker execution ‚Äî  
no local MongoDB setup is required.

### 1. Build and start all services

From the project root (where `docker-compose.yml` is located):

```bash
docker compose up --build
This will:

Build the Spring Boot JAR (testtask-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar) inside the container

Start both the application and MongoDB containers

2. Access the API
Once started, the backend will be available at:

üëâ http://localhost:8080
