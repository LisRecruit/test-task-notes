# üìù Note Task Manager

This is a RESTful application for managing notes, providing functionality for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting notes, as well as obtaining text statistics for each note.

The project is developed using **Spring Boot** and utilizes **MongoDB** as its data store.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Stack

* **Backend:** Java 21, Spring Boot 3

* **Database:** MongoDB 6.0

* **Build Tool:** Gradle

* **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose

* **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito, Testcontainers

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

To run the project, the following are required:

1. **Java 21** (for local development)

2. **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for running in containers)

## üöÄ Running the Project with Docker Compose

The project is configured to run in an isolated Docker environment, ensuring fast deployment and avoiding conflicts with local MongoDB installations.

**1. Build and Run:**

Use the following command to build the JAR file inside the container and simultaneously start all services (application + MongoDB). The `--build` flag is mandatory to ensure Docker compiles the JAR file.

docker compose up --build


**2. Accessing the Application:**

After a successful launch, the application will be available at:

http://localhost:8080/


**3. Stopping and Cleanup:**

To stop and remove the containers, use:

docker compose down


If you wish to completely remove the MongoDB database (Volume), use the `--volumes` flag:

docker compose down --volumes


## üó∫Ô∏è Key API Endpoints

The application provides a RESTful API accessible via port `8080`.
